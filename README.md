# Motion-Planning
This repository contains the assignments done under the course SC627 - Motion Planning & Coordination of Autonomous Vehicles. All the assignments are done in ROS and for assignment 2 and 3, TurtleBot Burger is used.    
The tasks of each assignment were as follows:-

Assignment1- Implement different sampling-based planners for the arm to move from its start joint angles to the goal joint angles. Your planner must return a plan that
 is collision-free for 3 algorthms( PRM, RRT & RRT*)

Assignment2- Implement a collision avoidance algorithm for the turtlebot to
 move from its starting position to its goals while avoiding dynamic and static obstacles. Your task is to write a collision avoidance algorithm based on artificial potential field to avoid
 static and dyanmic obstacles. The algorithm has to be tested in simulation as well as in the
 hardware.  

Assignment3- Write a planner for a point robot to catch a moving target in a 2D grid world. The gridworld is 8
connected (that is, the robot can only move by at most one unit along the X and/or Y axis). During
 execution, the planner will be given a costmap and the collision threshold. The costmap contains
 the associated cost for moving through each cell in the grid.
